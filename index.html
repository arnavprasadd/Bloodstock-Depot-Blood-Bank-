                    <h3>What is Blood Bank Management System</h3>
                    Blood banks play an important role in the process of collecting blood and managing blood stocks, approving blood requests, updating donations and updating available blood types. BBMS will address the issues and problems encountered in collecting information about donors, blood camps, inventories of blood bags, and blood transfusion services, etc, including donor screening, inventory management, blood ordering, blood usage review and compatibility testing. Blood Bank Management system will greatly increase the safety and quality of the blood supply as well as provide logistics data for the optimal supply chain management.

              <h3>The Need for Blood</h3>
              Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. Safe blood saves lives. There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed. A simple act of donating blood can save lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Who you could help</h3>
            A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions. Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and surgical and cancer patients.
        </p>
          <p>
              <h3>Blood Group</h3>
              The 4 different blood groups in the ABO system are A, B, AB and O. A person's blood group is determined by a pair of genes - one gene inherited from each parent. Each blood group is identified by its own set of molecules (called antigens), which are located on the surface of red blood cells. When a person needs a blood transfusion, the donated blood must match the recipient's blood or complications will occur. There are eight main blood types but some are rarer than others. The list below shows the percentage of donors with each blood type:
              <ul>
                <li>O positive: 35%</li>
                <li>O negative: 13%</li>
                <li>A positive: 30%</li>
                <li>A negative: 8%</li>
                <li>B positive: 8%</li>
                <li>B negative: 2%</li>
                <li>AB positive: 2%</li>
                <li>AB negative: 1%</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Why Become A Donor</h3>
                Donating blood regularly is beneficial to prevent and reduce heart attacks and liver ailment. It helps in maintaining the iron level in the body and thus reduce those risk. Blood donation helps in lowering the risk of cancer. By donating blood regularly the iron level in the blood is balanced and the risk of cancer-related to the liver, lungs, and intestine gets lower. Once we donate blood, the body tries to restore the blood loss. This helps in the production of the new blood cells and maintain good health. Hemochromatosis is a disease that occurs due to increase in the absorption of iron by the body. Blood donation helps in reducing iron overload in the body and prevent Hemochromatosis. It is recommended to donate blood for those who are overweight. Regularly donating blood helps in weight loss and burn fat up to 650 calories. While donating blood, you not only lose weight but it also helps in reducing stress. Also, keeps the skin tight and wrinkle-free. The people who involve in the altruistic work have proven to live a longer life. Blood donation is altruistic works so it not only save lives of other but also helps you live longer and healthier.Every time we donate one pint of blood it helps save three lives, so if we donate four times in a year we end up saving 12 lives. We don’t have to be a superhero to save someone, a simple act of donating blood can also save lives.

                <h3>Universal Donors And Recipient</h3>
                Universal donors are those with an O negative blood type. Why? O negative blood can be used in transfusions for any blood type. Type O is routinely in short supply and in high demand by hospitals – both because it is the most common blood type and because type O negative blood is the universal blood type needed for emergency transfusions and for immune deficient infants. Approximately 45 percent of Caucasians are type O (positive or negative), but 51 percent of African-Americans and 57 percent of Hispanics are type O. Minority and diverse populations, therefore, play a critical role in meeting the constant need for blood. Types O negative and O positive are in high demand. Only 7% of the population are O negative. However, the need for O negative blood is the highest because it is used most often during emergencies. The need for O+ is high because it is the most frequently occurring blood type (37% of the population). The universal red cell donor has Type O negative blood. The universal plasma donor has Type AB blood.
